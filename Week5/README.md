# CMEE README WEEK 5

Spatial Analyses and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) (28/10/19 - 1/11/19)
This week will learnt key skills in using and handling GIS data, along with basic remote sensing to generate GIS data and the use of GIS data in a range of applications using R. We looked at creating and georeferencing both vector and raster data and how to use GIS tools to create a workflow to carry out simple analyses.
