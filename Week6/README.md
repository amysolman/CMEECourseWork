# CMEE README WEEK 6

Genomics and Bioinformatics (4/11/19 - 8/11/19)
Genetic data contain information about who organisms are, their relationships to other organisms, their population histories, and their histories of adaptation. Thus, genetic data and genetic techniques are central to addressing many questions in evolution, ecology, and conservation. New technologies allow for genetic characterization at the genomic level, and these data allow for an understanding of population processes at resolutions not possible in the past. The goal of this module was to introduce students to the types of questions that can be addressed with genomic data, and the methodologies that are available for answering these questions.
