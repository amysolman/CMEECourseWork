abstract = {Biodiversity is a central concept in ecology, fundamental to how we conceive of the natural world, measure human impacts on it, and orient conservation efforts to protect it. When species are lost, their links are lost, and functions for which they are responsible can be lost as a result. There is evidence of an intuitive link between diversity and function, where more diverse systems should generally include a greater number of functions with a greater amount of redundancy built into them, but defining this link has proven difficult. This is an important challenge in ecology, however, because the function and stabilizing role of biodiversity is one of the most important arguments for its preservation. This thesis examines the role of biodiversity in ecosystem function and community stability grassland communities across Silwood Park. The experiment uses natural gradients in plant diversity, measured in a number of alternative ways. Species richness can be an imperfect metric for investigating the link between diversity and ecosystem functioning but can be used as a proxy for more complex diversity measures in grassland communities at Silwood Park. There was no general relationship between plant species richness and plant biomass, and a negative relationship between plant richness and soil mesofaunal biomass. An extreme flooding event negatively impacted some soil mesofauna and not others whilst increasing biomass yield during the following year. Plant biomass stability was independent of species richness and soil mesofaunal biomass varied with either plant richness or plant biomass depending on the definition of stability being used. The inclusion of relative abundance and phylogenetic information allows us more predictive power when looking at the biodiversity-ecosystem function relationship for both primary and secondary production. Experiments such as DExtER are vital to understanding the role of diversity in natural communities.},

abstract = {A central challenge in community ecology is to predict patterns of biodiversity with mechanistic models. The neutral model of biodiversity is a simple model that appears to provide parsimonious and accurate predictions of biodiversity patterns in some ecosystems, even though it ignores processes such as species interactions and niche structure. In a recent paper, we used analytical techniques to reveal why the mean predictions of the neutral model are robust to niche structure in high diversity but not low-diversity ecosystems. In the present paper, we explore this phenomenon further by generating stochastic simulated data from a spatially implicit hybrid niche-neutral model across different speciation rates. We compare the resulting patterns of species richness and abundance with the patterns expected from a pure neutral and a pure niche model. As the speciation rate in the hybrid model increases, we observe a surprisingly rapid transition from an ecosystem in which diversity is almost entirely governed by niche structure to one in which diversity is statistically indistinguishable from that of the neutral model. Because the transition is rapid, one prediction of our abstract model is that high-diversity ecosystems such as tropical forests can be approximated by one simple model—the neutral model—whereas low-diversity ecosystems such as temperate forests can be approximated by another simple model—the niche model. Ecosystems that require the hybrid model are predicted to be rare, occurring only over a narrow range of speciation rates.},

Here we present a multi‐scale spatial assessment of soil bacterial community profiles across Great Britain (> 1000 soil cores), and show the first landscape scale map of bacterial distributions across a nation. Bacterial diversity and community dissimilarities, assessed using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, were most strongly related to soil pH providing a large‐scale confirmation of the role of pH in structuring bacterial taxa. However, while α diversity was positively related to pH, the converse was true for β diversity (between sample variance in α diversity). β diversity was found to be greatest in acidic soils, corresponding with greater environmental heterogeneity. Analyses of clone libraries revealed the pH effects were predominantly manifest at the level of broad bacterial taxonomic groups, with acidic soils being dominated by few taxa (notably the group 1 Acidobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria). We also noted significant correlations between bacterial communities and most other measured environmental variables (soil chemistry, aboveground features and climatic variables), together with significant spatial correlations at close distances. In particular, bacterial and plant communities were closely related signifying no strong evidence that soil bacteria are driven by different ecological processes to those governing higher organisms. We conclude that broad scale surveys are useful in identifying distinct soil biomes comprising reproducible communities of dominant taxa. Together these results provide a baseline ecological framework with which to pursue future research on both soil microbial function, and more explicit biome based assessments of the local ecological drivers of bacterial biodiversity.},

Here, soil samples were collected along a typical aridity gradient in semi-arid regions in Inner Mongolia, China, to investigate whether and how the increasing aridity affects archaeal communities. The results showed that archaeal richness linearly decreased with increasing aridity. After partialling out the effects of soil properties based on partial least squares regression, the significant aridity-richness relationship vanished. The composition of archaeal communities was distributed according to the aridity gradient.

abstract = {Although many molecular ecological surveys have been conducted, there is little concerning the details of specific bacterial groups, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the microorganismal composition and community structures in the environment. Myxobacteria are micropredators that are metabolically active in the soil microbial food web and have typically been considered minority components of soil bacterial communities. In this study, we surveyed the percentage of myxobacteria in a single soil sample via pyrosequencing on combined universal libraries of the 3‐4 and 6‐8 hypervariable regions of the 16 gene. Surprisingly, myxobacteria accounted for 4.10\% of the bacterial community and 7.5\% of the total operational taxonomic units at the 3\% similarity level in the soil, containing almost all of the cultivated myxobacterial families or genera. To testify the appearance of myxobacteria in soil niches, we retrieved myxobacteria‐related 16 gene sequences of 103 high‐throughput sequencing data sets obtained from public databases. The results indicated that myxobacteria‐related sequences were among the predominant groups in these data sets accounting for 0.4–4.5\% of bacterial communities. The abundance of myxobacterial communities were correlated with site temperature, carbon‐to‐nitrogen ratio and pH values. Based on these results, we discussed the survival strategies of myxobacterial community in soil.},
