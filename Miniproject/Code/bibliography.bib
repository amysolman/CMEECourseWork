abstract = {There is a widespread opinion among ecologists that ecology lacks general laws. In this paper I argue that this opinion is mistaken. Taking the case of population dynamics, I point out that there are several very general law‐like propositions that provide the theoretical basis for most population dynamics models that were developed to address specific issues. Some of these foundational principles, like the law of exponential growth, are logically very similar to certain laws of physics (Newton's law of inertia, for example, is almost a direct analogue of exponential growth). I discuss two other principles (population self‐limitation and resource‐consumer oscillations), as well as the more elementary postulates that underlie them. None of the “laws” that I propose for population ecology are new. Collectively ecologists have been using these general principles in guiding development of their models and experiments since the days of Lotka, Volterra, and Gause.},

abstract = {The logistic curve was introduced by Raymond Pearl and Lowell Reed in 1920 and was heavily promoted as a description of human and animal population growth. In subsequent years it underwent a barrage of criticism from statisticians, economists, and biologists, a barrage directed mostly against Pearl's claim that the logistic curve was a law of growth. Nevertheless, it emerged in the mid-1930's as a central model of experimental population biology, and in its various modifications has remained an important part of modern population ecology. The history of the logistic curve reveals that its acceptance was by no means straightforward: repeated promotion of the curve by Pearl and his connections to other scientists were both important in the establishment of its place as a tool of research. The people responsible for legitimizing the logistic curve - A. J. Lotka, G. F. Gause, G. Udny Yule, and Thomas Park - all had different degrees of direct contact with Pearl in the early years of its use, and these personal contacts facilitated the acceptance of the logistic curve despite the heawy criticisms. The history of the logistic curve reveals the complicated social processes which can underlie the development of scientific disciplines.},
