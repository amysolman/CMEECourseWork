# CMEE README WEEK 4

Statistics in R (21/10/19 - 25/10/19)
In this module we built upon the introduction to R we received in the Biological Computing in R week and learned a core set of statistical methods that are of wide use in research projects. These statistical tests form the basis for many data analyses we will do in the future. 
. Topics included:
- Basic statistics for ecology and evolution, with a focus on applicability. 
- Parametric tests (descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, correlations, linear models, hypothesis testing).
