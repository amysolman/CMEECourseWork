# Linear functions
# Decartes - Cartesian coordinates
# Can describe any point with coordinates x, y
# Y is response variable, x explanitory variable
# 
# Explanatory vs response variable:
# Bigger sparrows are heavier (x, y)
# Male sparrows are heavier (x, y)
# Food-rich areas have more animals (y, x)
# 
# Linear functions
# Used to describe a line in a cartesian coordinate system
# y = mx + b
# y coordinate depends on x
# m = slope
# b = intercept
# To find the slop count one to the right of the line
# then count up until you meet the line again
# 
# Degrees of freedom for a line: n - 2 (y and intercept)
# Where n is the number of observations in the sample
# 
# DF for a line that goes through the origin?
# DF for a line with slope 1 and a variable intercept?
