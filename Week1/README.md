# CMEE README WEEK 1

CMEE Bootcamp Week1 (30/09/19-04/10/19)
This week we were introduced to the UNIX system and shell scripting. We covered topic areas including:

 - Introduction to UNIX
 - Shell scripting
 - Version control with Git
 - Scientific documents with LaTex

 All work completed used Mac OS Mojave version 10.14.6 and the code editor Visual Studio Code. Below is a comprehensive guide to all files and scripts within the WEEK1 directory of my CMEECourseWork folder.

# Sandbox

  - Directory - TestFind: Directories with plain text files for practising search skills through the terminal.
  - Directory - TestWild: Files with different names/extensions for practising finding files using wildcards.
  - File - test.txt and test.txt.csv: Input and output files respectively for tabtocsv.sh (../Week1/Code).
  - File - ListRootDir.txt: Text file with copy of root directory as created in terminal.

# Code

  - File - FirstBiblio.bib: Imported citation from Google Scholar for FirstExample.tex
  - File - FirstExample.tex: LaTex example created in VS code
  - File - FirstEample.pdf: Output of LaTex generated paper plus imported citation
  - File - boilerplate.sh: Gives example of basic shell script format and prints "This is a shell script!" into terminal
  - File - CompileLaTex.sh: Bash script to compile LaTex with Bibtex
  - File - Csvtospace.sh: Bash script that takes comma separated values and converts to space separated values. Results in ..Week1/Data/Temperatures
  - File - tabtocsv.sh: Bash script that takes tab delimited values and converts to comma separated values 
  - File - variables.sh: Bash script showing how to add a string to a variable, then read multiple values and calculate the sum
  - File - MyExampleScript.sh: Prints two variables (Hello and username), then prints Hello and username again
  - File - CountLines.sh: Counts the number of lines in a file
  - File - ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh: Concatenates two files and outputs them into a third
  - File - tiff2png.sh: Converts a tiff to a png file
  - File - UniPrac1.txt: Three fasta files of DNA sequences were pulled from the Git Repository. Code was written for the following:
1) To count how many lines were in each file
2) To print everything starting from the second line from the E.coli genome (E.coli.fasta)
3) To count the sequence length of the E.coli genome
4) To count the matches of "ATGC" in the E.coli genome
5) To compute the AT/GC ratio

# Data
  - Directory - Temperatures: Contains four csv files (1800, 1801, 1802, 1803) and the converted txt files from the script csvtospace.sh (../Week1/Code)
  - File - Spawannxs.txt: List of UN protected species used in practise grep commands
