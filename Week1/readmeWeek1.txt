FirstExample.bbl: Created in the process of creating pdf for FirstExample.tex
FirstExample.blg: Created in the process of creating pdf for FirstExample.tex
FirstExample.tex: My first LaTex example created in VS code
FirstEample.pdf: Output of LaTex generated paper plus imported citation
boilerplate.sh: Gives example of basic shell script formate and prints "This is a shell script!" into terminal
CompileLaTex.sh: Bash script to compile LaTex with Bibtex
Csvtospace.sh: Bash script that takes comma separated values and converts to space separated values
tabtocsv.sh: Bash script that takes tab eliminated values and converts to comma separated values

CountLines.sh: Counts the number of lines in a file
ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh: Concatenates two files and outputs them into a third
tiff2png.sh: Converts a tiff to a png file
UniPrac1.txt: Three fasta files of DNA sequences were pulled from the Git Repository. Code was written for the following:
1) To count how many lines were in each file
2) To print everything starting from the second line from the E.coli genome (E.coli.fasta)
3) To count the sequence length of the E.coli genome
4) To count the matches of "ATGC" in the E.coli genome
5) To compute the AT/GC ratio

DATA
Temperatures folder: Contains four csv files (1800, 1801, 1802, 1803) and the converted txt files from the script csvtospace.sh (in Code folder)
