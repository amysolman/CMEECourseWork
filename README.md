# CMEE README

My CMEE Coursework Repository

This repository contains the coursework for my CMEE MRes at Imperial College London. The programs therein use shell scripting, python and R. 

Work is divided into week-specified subdirectories (Week1/Week2...) except for where indicated.

Week 1

Practicals using command line and shell scripting only. Sandbox contains practise files. Code contains shell scripts. Data contains data files used with shell scripts. Plus README.md. 

Week 2

Biological computing in Python I. Including: using data structures, writing code, control flow tools, comprehensions, debugging etc.

Week 3

Biological computing in R. Including: Variable types, data structures, manipulating data, control flow tools, vectorisation, data management and visualisation.

Week 4

Statistics in R. Including: Basic statistics for ecology and evolution, with a focus on applicability. Mostly parametric tests (descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, correlations, linear models, hypothesis testing).

Week 5

Spatial Analyses and Geographic Information Systems. Including: GIS data types, obtaining and handling GIS data, creating maps, basic data analyses and hypothesis testing in the spatial domain.

Week 6

Genomics and Bioinformatics. Including: understanding genomic data collection methods, how to choose data collection technique, genomic databases, genetic structure within/between populations, how to characterise and interpret results of common analyses such as STRUCTURE and PCA.

Week 7

Biological Computing in Python II. Including: program testing, debugging and documentation, retrieving, managing and analyzing data from local and remote databases, automate file handling, string manipulation and run shell scripts, efficient numerical analyses, patching together R and Python scripts and functions.

Miniproject (Week 8)

Selected own dataset out of selection of three. Carried out computationally intensive analysis that includes elements of shell scripting, R & Python, addressing questions involving data processing and model fitting, writing up and compiling a meaningful report on the analysis.

Week 9

High Performance Computing. Including: develop an advanced understanding of programming in R, principles of High Performance Computing.
