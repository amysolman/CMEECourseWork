# CMEE README

My CMEE Coursework Repository

This repository contains the coursework for my CMEE MRes at Imperial College London. The programs therein use shell scripting, python and R. 

Work is divided into week-specified subdirectories (Week1/Week2...) except for where indicated.

Week 1

Practicals using command line and shell scripting only. Sandbox contains practise files. Code contains shell scripts. Data contains data files used with shell scripts. Plus README.md. 

Week 2

Biological computing in Python I. Including: using data structures, writing code, control flow tools, comprehensions, debugging etc.

Week 3

Biological computing in R. Including: Variable types, data structures, manipulating data, control flow tools, vectorisation, data management and visualisation.

Week 4

Statistics in R. Including: Basic statistics for ecology and evolution, with a focus on applicability. Mostly parametric tests (descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, correlations, linear models, hypothesis testing).

Week 5

Spatial Analyses and Geographic Information Systems. Including: GIS data types, obtaining and handling GIS data, creating maps, basic data analyses and hypothesis testing in the spatial domain.

Week 6

Genomics and Bioinformatics. Including: understanding genomic data collection methods, how to choose data collection technique, genomic databases, genetic structure within/between populations, how to characterise and interpret results of common analyses such as STRUCTURE and PCA.

Week 7

Biological Computing in Python II. Including: program testing, debugging and documentation, retrieving, managing and analyzing data from local and remote databases, automate file handling, string manipulation and run shell scripts, efficient numerical analyses, patching together R and Python scripts and functions.

Miniproject (Week 8)

Selected own dataset out of selection of three. Carried out computationally intensive analysis that includes elements of shell scripting, R & Python, addressing questions involving data processing and model fitting, writing up and compiling a meaningful report on the analysis.

Week 9

High Performance Computing. Including: develop an advanced understanding of programming in R, principles of High Performance Computing.

Project

Working folder for dissertation project, including project proposal.

# CMEE README WEEK 1

CMEE Bootcamp Week1 (30/09/19-04/10/19)
This week we were introduced to the UNIX system and shell scripting. We covered topic areas including:

 - Introduction to UNIX
 - Shell scripting
 - Version control with Git
 - Scientific documents with LaTex

 All work completed used Mac OS Mojave version 10.14.6 and the code editor Visual Studio Code. Below is a comprehensive guide to all files and scripts within the WEEK1 directory of my CMEECourseWork folder.

# Sandbox

  - Directory - TestFind: Directories with plain text files for practising search skills through the terminal.
  - Directory - TestWild: Files with different names/extensions for practising finding files using wildcards.
  - File - test.txt and test.txt.csv: Input and output files respectively for tabtocsv.sh (../Week1/Code).
  - File - ListRootDir.txt: Text file with copy of root directory as created in terminal.

# Code

  - File - FirstBiblio.bib: Imported citation from Google Scholar for FirstExample.tex
  - File - FirstExample.tex: LaTex example created in VS code
  - File - FirstEample.pdf: Output of LaTex generated paper plus imported citation
  - File - boilerplate.sh: Gives example of basic shell script format and prints "This is a shell script!" into terminal
  - File - CompileLaTex.sh: Bash script to compile LaTex with Bibtex
  - File - Csvtospace.sh: Bash script that takes comma separated values and converts to space separated values. Results in ..Week1/Data/Temperatures
  - File - tabtocsv.sh: Bash script that takes tab delimited values and converts to comma separated values 
  - File - variables.sh: Bash script showing how to add a string to a variable, then read multiple values and calculate the sum
  - File - MyExampleScript.sh: Prints two variables (Hello and username), then prints Hello and username again
  - File - CountLines.sh: Counts the number of lines in a file
  - File - ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh: Concatenates two files and outputs them into a third
  - File - tiff2png.sh: Converts a tiff to a png file
  - File - UniPrac1.txt: Three fasta files of DNA sequences were pulled from the Git Repository. Code was written for the following:
1) To count how many lines were in each file
2) To print everything starting from the second line from the E.coli genome (E.coli.fasta)
3) To count the sequence length of the E.coli genome
4) To count the matches of "ATGC" in the E.coli genome
5) To compute the AT/GC ratio

# Data
  - Directory - Temperatures: Contains four csv files (1800, 1801, 1802, 1803) and the converted txt files from the script csvtospace.sh (../Week1/Code)
  - File - Spawannxs.txt: List of UN protected species used in practise grep commands

#5 Compute the AT/GC ratio. That is, the (A+T)/(G+C) ratio. This is a summary measure of base composition of double-stranded DNA. DNA from different organisms and lineages has different ratios of the A-to-T and G-to-C base pairs. For example DNA from organisms that live in hot springs have a higher GC content, which takes advantage of the increased thermal stability of the GC base pair (google Chargaff's rule)
